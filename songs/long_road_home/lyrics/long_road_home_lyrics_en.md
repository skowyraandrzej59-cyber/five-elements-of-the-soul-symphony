# The Long Road Home  
*(Lyrics – Andrzej Skowyra)*

## Verse 1  
This long and winding road of mine,  
Through broken signs and fading lines…  
I drifted off — the night grew colder,  
My son and I beneath the clover.  
I woke to silence, sharp and clear,  
A voice inside I failed to hear.

## Chorus  
But this old heart still knows the way,  
Through all the dust and disarray.  
Past Amazon’s relentless hum,  
Toward a quiet truth that’s yet to come.  
It leads me home through fear and shame,  
To where the dawn still speaks my name.

## Verse 2  
Another night in a foreign town,  
Another road where I broke down.  
The miles rose up — a shadowed wall;  
I heard my name, a distant call…  
From those I love, from those I miss,  
Across the cold and lonely abyss.

## Chorus  
But this old heart still knows the way,  
Through all the weight of each long day.  
Past every ache, past every test,  
Toward a moment’s quiet rest.  
It leads me on through guilt and grace,  
To one familiar, waiting face.

## Bridge  
And all the battles left behind,  
The broken pieces I would find —  
They built a man, they forged a will,  
A silent promise I fulfill.  
For every scar, for every fall,  
I rise again — I give my all.

## Final Chorus  
And this old heart still knows the way!  
Through fire’s glow and dying day!  
Through all the years I couldn’t mend —  
This road will find its rightful end.  
It leads me home — it’s never lied,  
Through all the tears I never cried.

## Outro  
This long… long road…  
This long… long road…  
Leads me home… to my soul…  
Leads me home…
